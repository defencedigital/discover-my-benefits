# Welcome to the MOD rewards hub Homepage

This is just a single static html page (yes I mean real html) that is the homepage of Discover my benefits.


## How to get the project running:

run `npm install` to install dependencies.

run `npm run start:dev` for dev \
run `npm run start:uat` for uat \
run `npm run start:prod` for prod


## Questions

### Why is this in a separate repo?

Because reasons...

Seriously though it's because the react apps (aka MOD REWARDS HUB) architecture depends on service specific content being passed through to all pages.

The homepage didn't need any of that so for simplicity sake we put it in its own repo and here we are.

### Different html for every environment...Weird?

You'd think so but every now and then we want to see different content or scripts per environment.
